# Introduction
I started this project in the fall of 2016 to learn more about low-level programming, game design, and embedded systems. It's been a valuable learning experience and I'm hoping to be able to use what I've learned for future systems programming, as well as apply various principles to higher-level projects I work on in the future.

The game is written in low-level assembly language for the MOS 6502, an 8-bit CPU that was used in many home computers during the 1980s as well as the NES. While programming like this isn't very common nowadays (and for good reason), I've gained a wealth of indispensible knowledge related to computer architecture and what goes on under the hood of a program/system; as well as an appreciation for the numerous high-level languages and tools programmers today have at their disposal to make their job easier. I've definitely come out a more experienced, skilled and competent programmer, and a better critical-thinker.

# About the game
I Was Shipwrecked is a Survival-Adventure game remniscent of games like The Legend of Zelda, with elements such as random encounters and crafting. You've been shipwrecked on a desert island with nothing but a knife and a pistol with 30 rounds, and you must do whatever it takes to stay alive. Did anyone else survive the catastrophe? Just how big is this island? And will you be able to get off of it?

Press B to attack things and A to interact with the world around you. Watch your health, hunger and thirst meters. As long as you survive, you can save your progress and continue, but if you can't make it you'll have to start over from the beginning.

Inspiration taken mainly from Cast Away, Lost, and Robinson Crusoe, as well as numerous real-life accounts of actual shipwrecks / maroonings.

This is just a playable demo. The full version will be much bigger and more in-depth (It will also have an ending; for now the main goal is to just explore and survive for as long as possible.)

Currently, all music, art, and, with a few documented exceptions, programming has been done by me.

# About the code
Writing low-level code like this isn't very common these days except for a few areas of Computer Science / Computer Engineering. I did this project for fun, and didnt really have in mind originally that I'd make the source available to the public. Because of this, the comments/code aren't the most stranger-friendly. Add to that that it's already written in an obscure, scary-looking language by today's standards. For anyone who's actually curious about / interested in reading through the code or trying to decipher it, I tried to make the variables file and the main skeleton file as detailed as possible, but work could still be done. Despite this, I think its still worth having this project be open source; not just in case I ever lose the data on my computer, but also to showcase something I've done. This is definitely by far the biggest project I've ever worked on, and if (hopefully when) it ever gets finished, I want anyone who might want to see it to be able to see it.
One more thing I should add: As I've already said, I started this project with really just myself in mind, and wasn't concerned with professionalism. So there's likely to be some profanity scattered throughout the code / development journal here and there. Just a heads up.
